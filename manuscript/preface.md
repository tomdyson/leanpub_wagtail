# Preface

This book was considered one of the first and top learning resources for the Wagtail CMS framework. The book will be updated to keep up the changes of Wagtail CMS.

## Why I wrote this book

When I tried to build a CMS system using Wagtail CMS, I found out that there is no good resource for me to learn, all I can get is some simple blog posts or some GitHub projects which have no doc. So I decide to help people who are new to Wagtail CMS as well as those who want to add a new feature to existing Wagtail project.

** This book will teach you to create a standard blog step by step from scratch! **

To help people focus on the key part of the Wagtail, in this book I only paste part of the source code instead of the whole file. But all the source code can checkout from Github, so you can get it in your local env directly, debug or run.

By the end of this book, you will be able to create CMS system using Wagtail CMS and have a good understanding of it.

## Who is this book for

This book is for anyone interested in building a CMS using Python.

Basic Python knowledge is required, it would be better if you are familiar with Django.
